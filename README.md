RotMG Server Emulator - Zeroeh's Source

You can set up the database using the old method or by using xampp.

This source was made to run efficiently and is optimized for performance.

As for the projects getting renamed:
ServerEngine = wServer
ConServer = Server
GameObjects = db
The others are pretty self explanatory.
