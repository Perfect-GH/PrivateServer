=======BUGS (Minor/Major)=======
Minor: Players gain exp when paused. Players can teleport to paused players
Minor: Ignore doesn't even work XD (use ignore code for muting)
Major: Editing URL when buying gold, editing the number gives that amount.



=======Fixed Bugs=======
Characters slots for fame and people getting negative currency.
