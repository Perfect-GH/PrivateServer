===HELP===
I have included some video tutorials on C# for beginners or users that
would like to brush up on their skills. It is a 25-episode video series.

I have included a few videos and a few html files that you can open in
your browser. They are Actionscript tutorials that you can use to
edit the client.


===SOURCE===
There are lots of bugs with all RotMG Server Emulators in general but this
source should have only a few bugs. This source is more stable and
reliable than other sources available.


===INFO===
The current size of the source is roughly 200MB. With videos included
it is about 320MB.
