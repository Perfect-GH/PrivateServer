I'd like to first start off and say that this source is more optimized to run on hamachi, because
that is what I was using to host while I was working on the source. If you host this on a VPS, the 
network problems are yours to fix. The disconnect-on-hamachi bug has been slightly fixed and the 
majority of the networking problems have been solved.
