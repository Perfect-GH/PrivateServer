If you know what's good for you, log every change you do with the code in here so if you get errors,
you can come back and look to see what you need to revert to make it work again. It's painful but 
well worth the effort.

Current Worries/files of interest: NetworkHandler.cs and the Projectile/Enemy.cs
The projectile and enemy files are causing memory leaks while networkhandler has a temporary fix
for random disconnects but the client will "freeze" and not be able to do anything. This happens most
when you're afk


=======================November 4th============================
Oryx.cs - Changed the rate at which entities spawned, helped make wserver load "ping" sooner
Few logger codes added to various files in wserver (and server) to log players' actions. Just Ctrl+F entire solution with "logs" to find any logging code.
Changed some code in the entities folder (player.____.cs)
Added more logger code in random places in the wServer project.

=======================November 5th============================
Added InvertNova behavior in player.UseItem.cs
Created "MysteryBox.cs" under wServer\realm\entities\merchants (all lines are commented)
Editing XmlDatas.cs in the db project. Added all the prod xmls and their paths.

=======================November 6th============================
Edited NetworkHandler.cs so that players no longer randomly disconnect.

=======================November 7th============================
Edited Projectiles.cs  and Enemies.cs - These (still) are causing memory leaks

=======================December 25th===========================
Rebooting this project.
